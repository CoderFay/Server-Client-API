<h1>NASA APOD API Web Application.</h1>
<p>This code is a simple web application that uses NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API.
  The application allows users to input a date and retrieve the corresponding image and information from the API.
  The HTML file contains a form with an input field for the date and a submit button. The CSS file styles the form and response elements.
  The JavaScript code makes a GET request to the API with the date entered by the user, and then displays the retrieved image and information on the page.
  The application also includes a NASA logo in the navigation bar. Users need to replace the "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" string with their own API key to access the NASA APOD API.</p>
